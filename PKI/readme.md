# Task 1

Copy the configuration file into current directory:

```
cp /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf ./openssl.cnf
```

create new sub-directories and files according to what it specified in its `[ CA_default ]` section:

```
dir = ./demoCA # Where everything is kept
certs = $dir/certs # Where the issued certs are kept
crl_dir = $dir/crl # Where the issued crl are kept
new_certs_dir = $dir/newcerts # default place for new certs.
database = $dir/index.txt # database index file.
serial = $dir/serial # The current serial number
```

Simply create an empty file for `index.txt`, put a single number in string format in `serial`:

```
mkdir ./demoCA
cd ./demoCA
mkdir certs
mkdir crl
mkdir newcerts
touch index.txt
echo "1000" > serial
```

Start to generate the self-signed certificate for the CA:

```
openssl req -new -x509 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt -config openssl.cnf
```

When asked to type PEM pass phrase, remember the password you typed (e.g. I use `114514`). It will then ask you to fill in some information, you can skip it by <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

> The output of the command are stored in two files: `ca.key` and `ca.crt`. The file `ca.key` contains the CAâ€™s **private key**, while `ca.crt` contains the **public-key certificate**.
