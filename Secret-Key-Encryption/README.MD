# Task 1

- Step 1: Use the text of [the Gettysburg Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address) as the original article file [`gettysburg.txt`](./gettysburg.txt). The usage of `tr` is available in [GNU documentations](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/tr-invocation.html#tr-invocation). `-d` means 'delete' and `-cd` means 'delete the complement of', so first we just keep the letters, spaces, and newlines as the plaintext.
  
```
$tr [:upper:] [:lower:] < gettysburg.txt > lowercase.txt
$tr -cd '[a-z][\n][:space:]' < lowercase.txt > plaintext.txt
```

- Step 2: Use Python console to generate a permutation of `a-z`:

```python
>>> import random
>>> s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
>>> ''.join(random.sample(s,len(s)))
'azfgmunhrqwetlxicdksjbpvyo'
```

- Step 3: Encryption

```
$tr "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" "azfgmunhrqwetlxicdksjbpvyo" < plaintext.txt > ciphertext.txt
```

## Break 

Use http://www.richkni.co.uk/php/crypta/freq.php to analyze the frequency of `ciphertext.txt`, its full report shows as [`analysis.md`](./analysis.md).

By [single letter frequcey](./analysis.md#Letter-frequencies),the letters in ciphertext sorted by frequency are:

```
msaxhdlrgkefpnubjiztywcqvo 
```

Compared with letter frequency rank as  `eothasinrdluymwfgcbpkvjqxz` in modern English (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency))

```
$ tr 'msaxhdlrgkefpnubjiztywcqvo' 'eothasinrdluymwfgcbpkvjqxz' < ciphertext.txt > out1.txt
```

# Task 2

Ref to the [manual](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/openssl-enc.html) of `enc`.


## Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)

> Each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous cipher block.

![](./cbc.png)

```
openssl enc -ciphertype  -e -in plaintext.txt -out cbc_cipher.bin \
-K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff \
-iv 0102030405060708
```

## Cipher Feedback (CFB)

> The ciphertext from the previous block is fed into the block cipher for encryption, and the output of the encryption is XORed with the plaintext to generate the actual ciphertext.\

## Output Feedback (OFB)

> Similar to CFB, except that the data **before** *(while in CFB, it should be "after")* the XOR operation is fed into the next block.

## Counter (CTR)

> Each block of the key stream is generated by encrypting the counter value for the block. Nonce servers as IV, increased by some value (no need to be fixed to 1 ) as a counter.
