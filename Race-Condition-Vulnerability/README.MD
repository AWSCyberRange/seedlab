# Task 1

Fail to edit it even use root `vim`.

So first change its owner
```bash
sudo chown seed /etc/passwd
```
Then modify the file and return it to `root`
```bash
sudo chown root /etc/passwd
```
> I think the instruction can give more easy options: `sudo adduser test` then enter `U6aMy0wojraho` as its password or use GUI following [this document](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/user-add.html.en). Anyway, **it is too dangerous to edit `/etc/passwd` directly**.

Yes, I can log in test user using just an enter press and get the root privilege.

root@VM:~# whoami
root
```
